  <p>You probably know China. This is because it is one of the greatest world powers with the highest population. China is everywhere, at least products from China. Some examples of these are clothes, phones and all kinds of other stuff.
    Without China the economy would fall apart. Chinese is the most spoken language around the world. But what if I told you that something bad is going on in China? This is the lack of human rights. In China, people aren’t allowed to do
    certain stuff which we will talk about on this website. We will compare the human rights of China to The Netherlands since the human rights of the Netherlands are pretty normal.</p>

</div>
        <h2>social credit system</h2>
        <p>The social credit system is a system in which Chinese citizens are supposed to behave well in order to get social credit points. These points are very important since you are punished if you have a low amount of social credit points. If
          you have a low amount you will be punished. I will tell you about the punishments later. In this way, China is trying to control the behaviour of their citizens. They follow their behaviour by cameras and the internet. You can also get
          rewards for behaving well and having lots of social credit points.</p>
        <p>
          Right now China is still experimenting with the social credit system. They mainly try to follow citizen’s behaviour through digital equipment. Examples of these are phones and cameras. Your points go down if you violate the law. Your points
          will go up if you follow the laws and rules. If your points are very low you get punished for it like I said earlier. These punishments are: Not being able to travel by plane, bus, train or to sleep at a hotel. Another punishment could be
          that you and your family are banned from high education schools. This means that if for example a mother would have a low social credit her children wouldn’t be able to follow high education and therefore they might end up less successful.
          If your social credit is low then you are also not allowed to have a good-paid job. Another thing that will happen if your credit score is very low is “naming”. This means that their faces will be shown on boards because they have a low
          social credit score. This could also be called: “shaming”. The citizens of China think the social credit system is a positive change. ‘Their social trust will go up and the country will get less corrupted(amnesty.nl¹,nd).They think it’s good
          that people need to behave well. The only problem here is that they’re just being brainwashed by the Chinese government
        </p>



        <h2>freedom of expression</h2>


          <img src="https://share.america.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/JCGT6G-1-1068x712.jpg" width="250" height="150" alt="freedom of expression">

        <p>The freedom of expression in China is being more pressurized. China is reacting heavier to people with certain religions. Although this is happening, there are still hundreds of million people religious in China. The people who do not
          agree with the Chinese Communist Party are being punished because they “disrupted the social order. On the 10th of December, 1948 China confirmed the freedom of expression. Although they confirmed this, people who shared any religious or
          political opinions on the internet will get punished badly. ‘These punishments can be torture, execution or imprisoning(amnesty.nl1, nd).
        </p>
        <p>
          In China, Chinese citizens sometimes demonstrate against certain things. These demonstrations could be about schools for example. The Chinese government will be okay with this demonstration and do something to solve the problem. However,
          when there’s a demonstration that has to do with any religious or political subject they will immediately stop the demonstration. All these arguments support that China does not allow freedom of expression.
        </p>

        <h2>Uyghurs</h2>
        <p>The Uyghurs are a ethnic group in the more northern parts of China. These people moved from Turkey to China during the 18th century(amnesty.nl3, nd). The Uyghurs are a minority group in this region. Furthermore they are suppressed by the
          government. These people are being put in re-education camps by the Chinese government. In these camps the Uyghurs and other minority groups are being tortured, sexual attacked and they have to perform lots of hard work. The Chinese
          government has denied for a long time that these camps exist while in the meantime the UN found proof that these camps actually exist. Nowadays the Chinese government says that people go there voluntarily to get re-educated.

        <h2>Olympic winter games</h2>
        <div class="e_image">
          <img src="https://www.anocolympic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Logos_Beijing2022_Olympics_Paralympics_1000-600.jpg" width="225" height="200" alt="Logos_Beijing2022_Olympics_Paralympics_1000">
        </div>
        <p>the Olympic winter games are being held this year in China, normally politicians will go there to kind of represent their country. (NOS, 2022)this year a lot of countries (especially western countries) won’t send their politicians there
          because of what China is doing right now with the Uyghurs and other things. They hope by doing this that they give a message to the Chinese government. Lately there were also other reasons why politicians won’t go there. A few months back a
          tennis player said something bad about the government, a few days later she disappeared and nobody heard of her. After a few weeks she returned and she said that she just took some time off. However some people say that the government
          kidnapped her and held her hostage for these few weeks. These are all reasons why a lot of western countries won’t send politicians to China during the Olympic winter games.
        </p>

        <h2>Surveillance</h2>
        <p>China's government knows everything that goes on both in their country, and also outside their country. China's government monitors its own citizens through the internet and cameras, as well as some other digital systems. This is known as
          mass surveillance. </p>
        <p>
          China has designed some of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems in the world in order to predict the minds of people, and to brainwash them through the internet. One of China's most successful apps is tiktok, with over a
          billion downloads worldwide. Tiktok has become the most popular social media in many countries, but it has actually been designed by companies that partner with the Chinese government and sells them all the information it can gather so that
          the Chinese government can know everything about the populations of countries. Tiktoks algorithm is also designed to boost videos that are positive of China and take down or shadow ban videos that are negative towards China in any way. </p>
        <p>This
          is propaganda and the way tiktok is designed is that it gets people addicted so they spend hours every day scrolling through tiktok, which is how the propaganda works so well. China now has millions of people in countries that they are
          planning to take over scrolling on an app they own for hours a day, which means they can show them whatever they want to and convince them whatever they want to.</p>
        <p>The US found this a major security issue which is why they decided to ban tiktok, although this did not happen yet, people that work for the army are not allowed to have tiktok on work or even personal devices and they are also advised to
          uninstall the app from their children's devices. ‘Some other countries have blocked tiktok such as Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh(Shkurtaj, 2021)</p>
        <p>
          Although it is not yet known what the Chinese government is planning to do with this information, we do know that they are planning on world domination.</p>

        <h2>China VS The Netherlands</h2>
        <p>Some people are luckier than others, for example, most of you reading this are from the Netherlands. The Netherlands is a safe place with a pretty stable and equal government, all citizens of the Netherlands have human rights no matter
          what you look like or believe in.</p>
        <p> This means that in the Netherlands you can share your opinion no matter what it is, you can believe what you want, and you can be a part of any religion. You might think that this is common sense, but in some countries this is totally not
          the case. In China, the government violates many human rights. ‘Chinese citizens are banned from believing in some religions, sharing opinions that oppose the government, leaking certain information about what happens inside the country and
          many more things’(state.gov, between 2017 and 2021) .
        <p> If you do any of these you might depending on what you did get imprisoned, put in labour camps, executed, tortured, or even have family members receive a similar punishment as well.
          In the Netherlands we have a court system, if you are being accused of a crime you have the right to a lawyer and the right to try and prove your innocence.</p>
        <p> In China people are most of the time not treated like this, if authorities believe you did something they can punish you without sufficient evidence. This is due to corruption in the system which means that the government can do what they
          want.</p>
        <p> And since they hold so much power in the global economy, not many other countries or unions dare to do anything to stop this in fear of becoming enemies with them.</p>
        <p>
          With all this being said, does this mean the Netherlands is perfect, does this mean there is no corruption in the Netherlands? No, unfortunately every country faces issues with corruption and human rights violations, some countries just way
          more than others.</p>

        <p>These are the official lyrics and a link to the original song: </p>

        <p>[Intro: JAY-Z]
          Yeah</p>

        <p>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
          Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
          Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
          I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
          I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
          I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
          Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
          Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
          Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
          Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
          Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
          Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
          Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
          Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
          Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
          Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
          Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
          In New York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)
          Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
          There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah) (Okay)
          Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
          These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
          Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (Okay)
          Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG) (Uh)
          New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)</p>

        <p>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
          Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
          Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
          You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
          But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
          Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
          Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
          Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
          For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
          Eight million stories out there in the naked
          City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
          Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, "I Got It Made"
          If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
          Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
          Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
          Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
          Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
          In New York (Ayy) (Uh, yeah)
          Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
          There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (Okay)
          Now you're in New York (Welcome to the bright lights, baby) (Uh, yeah)
          These streets will make you feel brand-new
          Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
          Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
          New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
          [Verse 3: Jay-Z]
          Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
          So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
          Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
          Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
          Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
          Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
          City of sin is a pity on a whim
          Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
          Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
          Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
          "Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
          And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
          Came here for school, graduated to the high life
          Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
          MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
          The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
          In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
          Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
          There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
          Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
          These streets will make you feel brand-new
          Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
          Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
          New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
          [Bridge: Alicia Keys]
          One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
          Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
          No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
          Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
          "Yeah, yeah" (Come on, come on)
          "Yeah, yeah" (Come on)</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
          In New York (Uh, yeah)
          Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
          There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
          Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
          These streets will make you feel brand-new
          Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
          Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
          New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ydMlTassYc" target="New">link to the song</a>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p> And these are the lyrics we made for our cover</p>
        <p> (yeah), Here in the netherlands, we have freedom
          Human rights are important, that's why we gotta keep them </p>

        <p> these rights make us human, everyone should have them
          some countries neglect rights, that's something i can't fathom</p>

        <p> our example, China, they violate so many rights
          if against authority, you shouldn't expect equal fights</p>

        <p> so many put in labor camps, because of their religion
          if you leak any information, you will be put into prison</p>

        <p> socials blocked, you can't use snapchat or facebook
          mass surveillance, you can't get any privacy either</p>

        <p> Whereas here in Europe, We can say what we want
          You can do whatever as long as it's not illegal</p>

        <p> In the netherlands it doesn't matter what you look like
          We're all treated equally, even if you don't know how to bike</p>

        <p> Yeah we should be greatful, That were in a safe place
          A place where no one is allowed to be hateful</p>


        <p> In chinaaaaaa
          human rights that everybody should have
          there is nothing you can do
          now you’re in china
          these politicians make you feel bad
          camps will defeat you
          let’s hear it from china
          chinaa chinaa</p>

        <p> human rights, everyones should have human rights.
          But not everybody does, look at china.
          In China there are people that have no rights.
          The Uyghurs for example. they are being treated like animals
          they are being raped, tochered, labour and a lot more
          In the Netherlands we are free of this, but not everybody is.
          china also take people's freedom of speech,
          They aren’t allowed to have apps that aren’t from china.
          How do we change this? That's what's coming now.
          if everybody heard this song, everybody will know whats going on
          also if we won’t except wat’s china is doing now
          if we all stopped going there they would change.
          and if they don’t their economy will collapse and eventually they will change
          so let’s all do it together, make sure they will change
          so lets sing this together, so everybody start with me </p>

        <p> In chinaaaaaa
          human rights that everybody should have
          there is nothing you can do
          now you’re in china
          these politicians make you feel bad
          camps will defeat you
          let’s hear it from china
          chinaa chinaa</p>


        <p> Social credit, you might have heard of it

        <p> So they can have an influence, on those poor citizens
          having to perform well, to create a better life
          and not be punished for their small mistakes

        <p> China is trying to get people to behave like they want to,
          Restricting their freedom and opinions

        <p> Social credit, they get it when they behave well
          This is an illegal way of keeping control over citizens. </p>

        <p> Freedom of expression, not allowed to share opinions
          political or religious, you will face consequences </p>

        <p> These consequences are execution, torture or imprisoning</p>

        <p> And protests are useless, China won’t change</p>

        <p> Something needs to be done about this,
          We have to fight to stop this nonsense
          execution, social credt, torture
          all these things are bad
          This is why we have to work together to fix this</p>

        <p>but China won’t give up, we can do this </p>


        <p>In chinaaaaaa
          human rights that everybody should have
          there is nothing you can do
          now you’re in china
          these politicians make you feel bad
          camps will defeat you
          let’s hear it from china
          chinaa chinaa </p>

        <p> one hand in the air for the charities
          street camps, speech freedom, al lookin bad
          no place in the world that could compare
          put your hands in the air and everybody say
          yeah yeah
          yeah yeah </p>

        <p> In chinaaaaaa
          human rights that everybody should have
          there is nothing you can do
          now you’re in china
          these politicians make you feel bad
          camps will defeat you
          let’s hear it from china
          chinaa chinaa </p>
